#Chapter 1

##Why did I do this research?

####TLDR: 

Newsrooms don't do a very good job with documentation. We need better examples of how we can deal with the loss of institutional knowledge. This guide will help newsrooms think about their processes, what they are doing well and could be doing better. It'll include real-world examples from survey respondents as well as a checklist for newsrooms of all sizes (small, medium, large).

*Note: Some of this background comes from a piece I had previously [published](https://medium.com/@sandhya__k/onboarding-5d0757bdb34d#.dov049or3) in June of 2016*

As a [Knight-Mozilla fellow](https://opennews.org/what/fellowships/2016meet/), I wanted to do some type of research during my fellowship that could benefit the news community. During my 10-month fellowship in Berlin in 2016, I've spent about eight months researching, collecting data and interviewing reporters, editors, managers and directors about their on-boarding and off-boarding processes. 

In March at the [National Institute of Computer-Assisted Reporting](https://ire.org/conferences/nicar2016/) (NICAR) Conference, I was inspired to dive deeper into my research after conversations I had with friends from different newsrooms across the country. I chatted with friends (some of whom recently began their jobs) and others who were helping on-board new people into their newsroom. There was a common thread among these conversations: **frustration**. Often, people were frustrated because of improper documentation and the lack of a process for when someone left a position or began.

I asked around if people had thought about creating a process for on-boarding or off-boarding, besides the orientation people usually get from human resources (HR), which doesn’t always cover the files, systems and people that are important/referred to on the job. Many people I chatted with said they had thought about putting something together, but there just wasn’t enough time for them to do it. Others said they had a process, but it wasn’t enforced. Others mentioned documents they shared through email or an office wiki for storing important information or Github repositories for storing documentation.

This bothered me. And I knew I couldn't be the only one that is bothered by this. It seemed to me that we as a community should be helping each other think through these issues and how we can make these processes better and more efficient. If one newsroom has this figured out, we should be sharing this information so others can learn and make more places easier to work in.

I decided to use some of my fellowship year to spend time researching and interviewing people to see how reporters, editors and producers start and end their jobs in newsrooms all over the world. I tweeted this [out](https://twitter.com/sandhya__k/status/723514127000449024). 

Immediately, my notifications and emails became filled. Reporters, editors and producers wanted to know how other newsroom handle these processes. I created a survey to start collecting some information from newsrooms. I’ve heard from 221 newsrooms and 247 individuals.

###Why I spent 8 months working on this research

####My goal: to challenge the way we think about these processes and find what works for some newsrooms, what clearly doesn’t work in others and share my findings in one place.


I think it’s time we start talking about our processes (not just on-boarding and off-boarding) as a news community and think about simple ways to make these processes better. At a time when many newsrooms are laying off reporters and editors, and people are moving from one newsroom to the next, it’s really important for people to have a central repository or database of the documents that people worked on. In the past, some newsrooms had newsroom librarians and they would be the main keepers of documents and would be knowledgeable about the stories that are written over time in the newsroom. Unfortunately, many newsrooms have either gotten rid of these positions or have only one or two people in these roles, so it's even harder to have someone who really knows the ins and outs of the newsroom. 

*Think back to your first day of your job.* Was there some person or program you wished you encountered right away that you learned about later on? Instead of just keeping that knowledge to yourself, write the answer down. If you capture your answer now, it will be easy to share whenever you bring in new reporters or editors.

Some newsrooms do a good job of sharing their documentation on a project-by-project basis, but others just move onto the next big story without bothering to think about reproducibility or the future of their projects. The institutional knowledge one learns on the job does not always get passed along to the next reporter and because of that, they waste time trying to re-learn things that could have easily been shared. 

This institutional knowledge loss is a key issue that I've found while doing this research. It's not that people aren't thinking about losing knowledge in their newsrooms when a person leaves, but rather because of the quick-moving nature of the news, reporters and editors aren't spending the time to document their stories and work. In general, people on data/investigations teams do more documentation, because of the nature of their work (ex: code that is reused by others), but this is not always the case. 

People are often just worried about their own work, especially when they’re swamped with filing story after story or graphic after graphic. And they aren’t always thinking about what will happen when someone else has to reproduce their work or look at their notes and try to decipher the abstract meanings behind their column headers or file names. It’s just not a priority. I get it. This is especially true when many of us are dealing with breaking news. 

I know that I won’t be able to change all newsroom processes around the world completely overnight. I **can’t and won’t** say this way or that way is the **only** correct way of going about these processes because what works in **one newsroom may not necessarily work in another**.

I also understand that at the end of the day, reinforcement of this needs to come from higher-up editors who can spread new ideas or ask people to start putting a bit more time into documenting their work. And while it may not change the amount of information we report on, whether people realize it or not, these processes impact our daily and long-term reporting cycles.

Take for example: a project on shootings that is tracked over time using a spreadsheet with one reporter who knows the ins and outs of the process. Let’s say one day that he or she leaves the job and doesn’t take the time to document the project. Well, the next person who begins that very same job and who is asked to continue collecting the stats will be left clueless and trying to piece together the project. As a result, important things to keep in mind while reporting on this project (ex: data issues or key people) will be lost and at some point, the project will die because of the time suck that the lack of documentation caused.

If a formalized or any sort of process were in place and if someone were to leave the newsroom voluntarily or not, the newsroom would know what they worked on or didn’t do in their time on the job. They’d also have notes and information on projects or stories that they can begin to work on that the last person didn’t get to.

Many of the respondents to the survey said documentation issues are often a root cause of many of the problems their newsrooms experience on a daily basis. Just as we are documenting every day events and issues that the world is experiencing, we should be doing the same in our jobs. There's no need for us to reinvent the wheel by trying to answer the same questions and address the same issues over and over again. It's especially problematic because newsrooms have systems in place for many things and unfortunately, many of these processes are not documented, but are just things that people know in their heads and often learn on the job. So when a new person starts and asks "why is this process this way?", the answer is often just "because it's always been like this." This new person then learns the processes and the badly documented processes continue to snowball. This is not the way we should be working.

If even just one person on every team in the newsroom wrote down an outline of the questions they have, known issues, and the processes that they are aware of, I'm sure that there would be fewer pointless meetings and repetition of the same scenarios over and over again.

I hope that by the end of this guide, you'll begin to start thinking about implementing some sort of process in your newsroom, even if it's just beginning with a simple Word Doc of the information you’ve learned on the job. And if you end up using this work in your newsroom, I would love to hear about it. *See the acknowledgements(LINK HERE) for my contact information.*


###Survey questions and timeframe 

**Here are the questions asked in the survey:** 

-

Knight-Mozilla OpenNews fellow Sandhya wants to hear about how your newsroom is dealing with institutional knowledge that is lost when a person leaves your newsroom. This information will be used to think further about how we can make these processes more efficient. You can either answer these questions about your current newsroom or a prior newsroom. Thanks for your help in advance!

1. Is the newsroom your... 
	- prior 
	- current job?

2. What is the name of this newsroom?

3. Does your newsroom have a policy in place that requires or encourages reporters, editors, developers and producers to document their work before leaving? 

	*If yes, here are the questions that follow:*

 1. What is your newsroom policy for off-boarding or on-boarding?

 2. In terms of the policy: Is documentation done monthly, weekly, or daily or is it mostly done on a project-by-project basis? 
 		- monthly
		- weekly
		- daily
		- project by project basis

4. What about newsroom sources? Do you have a policy on what a reporter can take with them?

5. Now, I was mostly thinking of these questions in reference to people who voluntarily leave, but what about those who are fired? Are there any policies in place for retention of their notes? What about the passwords and logins that they take when they leave?

6. On-boarding: What about when a new person begins in the newsroom: are there documents that they receive (other than from HR)?

*If no, here are the questions that follow:*

 1. If you don't have a policy in place, I'd still like to hear from you. 

 2. What would you ideally like to see included in this policy?

7. Anything else you'd like to share that I haven't covered? 

8. Can I contact you for further questions? 

9. Your information:

###Overview of survey process and timeline 

I sent out the survey on April 22, 2016. I closed the survey on September 12, 2016. I heard from 221 newsrooms and 247 unique individuals. A total of 289 people filled out the survey. I conducted 101 interviews with individuals who filled out the survey. Thirty of them were over Skype or over the phone. The other 71 were email. 

At the beginning of the survey, I sent it to two of the Slack groups that I'm a part of: Journalists of Color & News Nerdery and then I sent emails to my mentors and friends to have them pass the survey along. I also sent it directly to about 20 newsrooms and then posted it several times on Twitter. 

In July, I talked to Elite Truong from Poynter about the research I was doing and she wrote up a [piece](http://www.poynter.org/2016/why-journalists-need-to-report-on-how-they-work/420138/) on my initial findings.
