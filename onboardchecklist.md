#On-boarding checklist

**Checklist of things to do/have for on-boarding process**

To-do:

- [ ] Read through documentation. Notes can include questions the previous person had when they started and answers, source information, contact list (could be in a Word doc, Github repo, markdown file)
- [ ] Write down questions. Don't be afraid to ask questions!
- [ ] For graphics/news apps folks: set up development environment, read through list of common tools used 
- [ ] Set up meetings with team members to learn about their roles on the team 
- [ ] Pair program or sit with another reporter (shadow a few desks, over a few days) 
- [ ] Have a mentor on the team (ideally this person would walk through what the previous person worked on and be there for any questions)
- [ ] Set up computer/accounts (ex: Twitter, Facebook, Github, email, encryption) 


Documentation to read through:

- [ ] Expectations for the job (what the previous person did and/or what the newsroom expects the person to work on. Examples include annual projects, attending certain meetings)
- [ ] Order of how stories and/or pitches get filed and how they go through the editing process (ex: points of contact, timeline for stories) 
- [ ] How to use the CMS and other software in the newsroom (ideally this would be a day or so training, and then there would be documents with screenshots explaining what different buttons in the CMS or software are)
- [ ] List of logins for social media, Github, servers and how to activate certain accounts (ex: PGP, set up email) 
- [ ] Glossary of common terms used in the newsroom or on the job in a document (for example if there is a list of acronyms for organizations that reporters on this beat usually contact or sources will often refer to)
- [ ] Newsroom style guide
- [ ] FOI status: previous FOIs filed, what data the team has, clean versions as well as the original files, key contact, follow-ups to be sent out
- [ ] Websites to bookmark, guide to common data sets that are used
- [ ] Timeline of ongoing topics on the beat (for example: a calendar of notable events on the beat or data releases)
- [ ] General notes/documentation on security in the newsroom (PGP, VPN, file sharing) 
- [ ] Common contacts (ideally this would include times when they are good to contact, if they prefer email vs. phone, etc.)
- [ ] Social media guidelines & policies
- [ ] Ethics policies


Overview for the team:

- [ ] Explanation of who is on the team, what they do, a little bit about them, where they are based if they are remote
- [ ] Company employee tree chart (if possible, include pictures of the people, so you can easily identify them)
- [ ] Spend some time on the company website looking through what the company does
- [ ] Newsroom map (where sections are, bathrooms, kitchen, etc.) 
- [ ] Helpful tips about the newsroom and processes (ex: these can include a number of things from meetings that one should attend to tips about CMS glitches to what's the best way to set up a meeting)
- [ ] Tips on the city that the newsroom is in (ex: nearby lunch places, buses, trains, etc.) 
- [ ] If a person is working remote: how do you support their needs? Talk through how they can be included and how being remote is different than being in the newsroom
