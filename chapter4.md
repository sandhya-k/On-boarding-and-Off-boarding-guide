#Small Newsroom guidelines

Five percent of the respondents from the survey were from small newsrooms. Of the small newsrooms, only three newsrooms said they had some sort of process for on-boarding and off-boarding, even if it wasn't formalized. For this pool of newsrooms, there was two people that I was able to interview. As I noted at the beginning of the guide, I feel that calling out certain newsrooms for their issues is not actually helpful. I'd much rather talk about the issues in general and talk through some solutions for the newsrooms. 

In general, the issues with small newsrooms are the same as medium and large newsrooms as I pointed out in chapter three. For small newsrooms, the biggest issue with getting these processes put into place is time and general adoption of understanding why documentation is so important. 

*A note about the categorization of newsrooms*

For the categorization of what is considered a "small" newsroom versus a "large" newsroom, I used the Online News Association Awards categories found [here.](https://journalists.org/awards/online-journalism-awards-rules-eligibility/)

A small newsroom is 50 or fewer employees. 

Here's a list of some of the small newsrooms that responded:

**Small**:
KPCC- Southern California
Center for Public Integrity 
De Correspondent

##Small newsroom challenges

One of the people I chatted with, [Adam Schweigert](https://twitter.com/aschweig) who is the Senior Director of Product and Technology at the Institute for Nonprofit News (INN) has by far one of the most comprehensive processes for documentation. Their documents are located [here](https://github.com/INN/docs) and are also linked to in the resources portion of chapter two (LINK HERE).

At INN, their documentation process started two years ago. While INN is a network of newsrooms, the core team who uses the documentation and wrote this guide up is six people. The team started the guide because there wasn't a guide like this that existed before and they wanted to share their knowledge. The team regularly revisits the documentation once a month and when a new person starts or someone leaves the team, they have them read through the documentation and update them. Because most of the team also works remote, these guides are even more helpful in making sure everyone is on the same page. The team also meets every quarter to revisit documentation in person.

Schweigert noted that he'd like to do more documentation days where they have one or two day sprints of just writing documentation on one thing that really needs work. This isn't always a possibility for newsrooms, especially small newsrooms, to set aside some days to do documentation, but he noted that if you create the culture of capturing your knowledge and fostering the idea of good documentation, it can be possible. 

For small newsrooms, in some cases, it can be easier to foster this mentality, since the teams are so small and can really benefit from documentation in some ways more than bigger newsrooms. For example, if one person in a small newsroom is the gatekeeper of newsroom knowledge and they leave, the newsroom is back to square one. Bigger newsrooms tend to have a little bit more documentation (for example, how to use the CMS, editing process timeline) because they typically have day-long or half-day trainings for new people. For small newsrooms, these trainings are often just one person teaching another person.

In general, the biggest takeaway from a team like INN, is that documentation can be done in a small newsroom and it can be very useful. It can live in a newsroom wiki or a Github repository like INN's does. Schweigert also noted that more newsrooms and teams should share their documentation because there is always a lot we can learn from others' processes. A good way he suggested of getting started with it is thinking of documentation as another product. If you make it a priority and not just an add on thing that would be nice and ideal if everyone did it, it can be very useful in the long run.

### How to deal with these processes for a small team and implement these ideas

No matter what size the team is, motivation to actually start thinking about these processes is really hard to start as a movement. One way of getting people motivated is to show them other people's documentation, (such as INN) and think about all the things in your job that you repeat and do on a daily basis. If you tell people they can save time in the long run if they just spend one or two days really thinking through what documentation would be helpful for the newsroom to have, it can also be a motivation. 

People like rewards and getting told they are doing good work. If you're writing good documentation and share it on Github and showcase that you're a newsroom that really cares about the future of the newsroom and how institutional knowledge will be handled, you could also be seen by other newsrooms as an example. In the case of INN, Schweigert noted that their guide has been helpful when they're recruiting or talking to people about what they do on a daily basis in their job. 

In a small newsroom, set up a meeting with the higher-up editors. Explain why documentation should be a priority and why making these processes for on-boarding and off-boarding are really important in keeping everyone in the newsroom on the same page. Take the checklist below and personalize it for your newsroom. 

The push for documentation should begin at the editors' level so that everyone knows that documentation is priority and should be done as a normal part of one's daily workflow. One way reporters can get started with making this a part of their workflow is spending fifteen minutes at the end of every day updating contact files and notes on what they worked on during that day. It may not be important to include all the notes one takes in the final documentation for one's job, but it can be really helpful to get into the mindset of writing down documentation. If not daily, even weekly documentation, for example, on Fridays could work too. 

If you're on a team of two people or you're not on a team at all, find someone in the newsroom that can read through your documentation and be your buddy. You read their documentation and add to it and they read yours and add to it. For those lone developers or data reporters, having someone who does not have a technical background and can read through the documentation and add to it can also add a new perspective to your documentation and way you think about your work.

###Checklist for on-boarding and off-boarding 

I included a similar checklist in chapter two of this guide, but here's a more specific checklist for those smaller newsrooms. Again, everything on this list doesn't need to be included, but these are suggestions of what is helpful in other newsrooms. 

**Checklist of things to do/have for on-boarding process**

- [ ] Explanation of who is in the newsroom, what they do, a little bit about them, where they are based if they are remote. Include pictures of people so you can easily identify them. You may also add a note near key people for the position 
- [ ] Expectations for the job (what the previous person did and/or what the newsroom expects the person to work on. Examples include annual projects, attending certain meetings)
- [ ] Order of how stories and/or pitches get filed and how they go through the editing process (ex: points of contact, timeline for stories) 
- [ ] How to use the CMS and other software in the newsroom (there would be documents with screenshots explaining what different buttons in the CMS or software are)
- [ ] List of logins for social media, Github, servers and how to activate certain accounts (ex: PGP, set up email) 
- [ ] For graphics/news apps folks: how to set up development environment, list of common tools used 
- [ ] Meetings with team members or people folks might work with to learn about their roles on the team or in the newsroom
- [ ] Spend some time on the company website looking through what the company does
- [ ] Pair program or sit with another reporter (shadow a few desks, over a few days) 
- [ ] Write down questions. Don't be afraid to ask questions!
- [ ] Include a glossary of common terms used in the newsroom or on the job in a document (for example if there is a list of acronyms for organizations that reporters on this beat usually contact or sources will often refer to)
- [ ] Have a mentor on the team or in the newsroom (ideally this person would walk you through what the previous person worked on and be there for any questions)
- [ ] Read through documentation written by the previous person in the job. Notes can include questions the person had when they started and answers, source information, contact list (could be in a Word doc, Github repo, markdown file)
- [ ] Timeline of ongoing topics on the beat (for example: a calendar of notable events on the beat or data releases)
- [ ] General notes/documentation on security in the newsroom (PGP, VPN, file sharing) 
- [ ] Read through common contacts (ideally this would include times when they are good to contact, if they prefer email vs. phone, etc.)
- [ ] Read over any social media guidelines & policies
- [ ] Read over any ethics policies the newsroom has

**Checklist of things to do/have for off-boarding process** 

- [ ] Writeup documentation about unfinished projects, questions, known issues, and projects worked on
- [ ] Have someone or a few people on the team or in the newsroom read through these documentation and ask questions if there are any
- [ ] Removal from social media accounts, Github, servers and any other accounts that are shared
- [ ] Disable CMS access
- [ ] Handoff of Google docs/shared documents
- [ ] Address FOIs or record requests that are ongoing and need to be followed up on. A spreadsheet tracking this information will be helpful to send to reporters/editors on the team and include in final documentation before leavings
- [ ] Rolodex: Update contact lists and notes on any sources that the next person should know about
- [ ] Exit interview with the newsroom or people you often work with: overview of the job (can be like office hours where people can stop by and ask questions about the position/stories)
