#Medium Newsroom Guidelines

Ten percent of the respondents from the survey were from medium newsrooms. Of the medium newsrooms, 90 percent of the newsrooms said they had some sort of process for on-boarding and off-boarding, even if it wasn't formalized.

In general, the issues with medium newsrooms are basically the same as small and large newsrooms as I pointed out in chapter three. It's always time that's the biggest constraint. For medium newsrooms, the biggest issue with getting these processes put into place is getting started with documentation and how to manage all the documentation since the newsroom is bigger and has some teams that will need very particular processes documented.

*A note about the categorization of newsrooms*

For the categorization of what is considered a "small" newsroom versus a "large" newsroom, I used the Online News Association Awards categories found [here.](https://journalists.org/awards/online-journalism-awards-rules-eligibility/)

A medium newsroom is 51 to 250 employees. 

Here's a list of some of the medium newsrooms that responded:

**Medium**:
St. Paul Pioneer Press
Tampa Bay Times
The Palm Beach Post
Foreign Policy Magazine 
ProPublica
Texas Tribune
Baltimore Sun
Frontline 
Intercept
Berliner Morgenpost
Reveal 

### How to deal with these processes for a medium team 

Of the medium newsrooms I spoke to, it was surprising that only six had some sort of process for on-boarding and off-boarding, even if it wasn't formalized. The biggest challenge the reporters said was getting their editors to sign off on letting them make time to write up documentation. For editors, the issue wasn't so much time, but worrying about teams repeating the same things over and over again by writing separate documentation. 

The solution? Having a newsroom wiki with all the documentation for on-boarding and off-boarding. It's a central place for everyone's documentation. If the editors focus on writing up the CMS docs and other common newsroom-wide documentation, the individual notes for teams can be added later. A lot of the bigger issues on the teams that I spoke to actually involved the bigger newsroom-wide processes. So if you target these processes first and make their documentation really thorough, it can be a motivation for the newsroom to write their own documentation. 

Of the teams that had documentation, they were often data/news applications teams and had their own documentation for their projects with commented out code on Github. This could be added to the newsroom wiki so people know that it exists and is showcased so other teams can be aware of what other parts of the newsroom are doing. This can help with understanding the work that the data and news applications teams do too, because non-technical people can learn (if they are interested) in what the lines of code mean. This can also serve as motivation for the entire newsroom to be more transparent and showing their work so others can learn from them.

### How to keep people motivated and implement these ideas

No matter what size the team is, motivation to actually start thinking about these processes is really hard to start as a movement. One way of getting people motivated is to show them other people's documentation and think about all the things in your job that you repeat and do on a daily basis. If you tell people they can save time in the long run if they just spend one or two days really thinking through what documentation would be helpful for the newsroom to have, it can also be a motivation. 

People like rewards and getting told they are doing good work. If you're writing good documentation and share it on Github and showcase that you're a newsroom that really cares about the future of the newsroom and how institutional knowledge will be handled, you could also be seen by other newsrooms as an example. 

Additionally, if higher up editors encourage the newsroom to embrace documentation and take time out of their day (even if it's once a week or so), this can help foster the importance of documentation.

###Checklist for on-boarding and off-boarding 

I included a similar checklist in chapter two of this guide, but here's a more specific checklist for those medium-sized newsrooms. Everything on this list doesn't need to be included, but these are suggestions of what is helpful in other newsrooms. 

**Checklist of things to do/have for on-boarding process**

- [ ] Explanation of who is in the newsroom, what they do, a little bit about them, where they are based if they are remote. Include pictures of people so you can easily identify them. You may also add a note near key people for the position 
- [ ] Detailed explanations of the roles on the team and how each work with one another
- [ ] Expectations for the job (what the previous person did and/or what the newsroom and team expects the person to work on. Examples include annual projects, attending certain meetings)
- [ ] Order of how stories and/or pitches get filed and how they go through the editing process (ex: points of contact, timeline for stories) 
- [ ] How to use the CMS and other software in the newsroom (there would be documents with screenshots explaining what different buttons in the CMS or software are)
- [ ] List of logins for social media, Github, servers and how to activate certain accounts (ex: PGP, set up email) 
- [ ] For graphics/news apps folks: how to set up development environment, list of common tools used, basics of how to document your projects
- [ ] Meetings with team members or people you might work with to learn about their roles on the team or in the newsroom
- [ ] Spend some time on the company website looking through what the company does
- [ ] Pair program or sit with another reporter and with another person on the team (shadow a few desks, over a few days) 
- [ ] Write down questions. Don't be afraid to ask questions!
- [ ] Include a glossary of common terms used in the newsroom or on the job in a document (for example if there is a list of acronyms for organizations that reporters on this beat usually contact or sources will often refer to)
- [ ] Have a mentor on the team or in the newsroom (ideally this person would walk you through what the previous person worked on and be there for any questions)
- [ ] Read through documentation written by the previous person in the job. Notes can include questions the person had when they started and answers, source information, contact list (could be in a Word doc, Github repo, markdown file)
- [ ] Timeline of ongoing topics on the beat (for example: a calendar of notable events on the beat or data releases)
- [ ] General notes/documentation on security in the newsroom (PGP, VPN, file sharing) 
- [ ] Read through common contacts (ideally this would include times when they are good to contact, if they prefer email vs. phone, etc.)
- [ ] Read over any social media guidelines & policies
- [ ] Read over any ethics policies the newsroom has

**Checklist of things to do/have for off-boarding process** 

- [ ] Writeup documentation about unfinished projects, questions, known issues, and projects worked on
- [ ] Have a few people on the team or in the newsroom read through these documentation and ask questions if there are any
- [ ] Removal from social media accounts, Github, servers and any other accounts that are shared
- [ ] Disable CMS access
- [ ] Handoff of Google docs/shared documents
- [ ] Address FOIs or record requests that are ongoing and need to be followed up on. A spreadsheet tracking this information will be helpful to send to reporters/editors on the team and include in final documentation before leavings
- [ ] Rolodex: Update contact lists and notes on any sources that the next person should know about
- [ ] Exit interview with the newsroom or people you often work with: overview of the job (can be like office hours where people can stop by and ask questions about the position/stories)
