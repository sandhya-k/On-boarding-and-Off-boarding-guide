#Medium Newsroom Guidelines

Ten percent of the respondents from the survey were from medium newsrooms. Of the medium newsrooms, only six of the newsrooms said they had some sort of process for on-boarding and off-boarding, even if it wasn't formalized.

In general, the issues with medium newsrooms are basically the same as small and large newsrooms as I pointed out in chapter three. It's always time that's the biggest constraint. For medium newsrooms, the biggest issue with getting these processes put into place is getting started with documentation and how to manage all the documentation since the newsroom is bigger and has some teams that will need very particular processes documented.

**A note about the categorization of newsrooms:**

For the categorization of what is considered a "small" newsroom versus a "large" newsroom, I used the Online News Association Awards categories found [here.](https://journalists.org/awards/online-journalism-awards-rules-eligibility/)

A medium newsroom is 51 to 250 employees. 

Here's a list of some of the medium newsrooms that responded:

**Medium**:
* St. Paul Pioneer Press
* Tampa Bay Times
* The Palm Beach Post
* Foreign Policy Magazine 
* ProPublica
* Texas Tribune
* Baltimore Sun
* Frontline 
* Intercept
* Berliner Morgenpost
* Reveal
