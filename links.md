#Links to some resources written about on-boarding

When I began this research, I looked for any links related to on-boarding and off-boarding processes in newsrooms. In the survey, many people I interviewed sent me their newsroom's files/guides if they had any, but because they contain information that may be private, I can't link to them. 

Here are some places that included the most thorough information on their on-boarding process. These can be used as a guide to what can be included in addition to my guide.
